Introduction:
The data set we have chosen represents real world data regarding hotel bookings (Antonio, de Almeida and
Nunes, 2019). There are 36 Columns with 119,390 observations. The data contains specific information for
each booking such as: country of customers, payment method, Agency used, number of adults/children etc.
We note that of the 119,390 observations there are 81,234 unique names, and 115,425 unique emails.

Business Problem: 
In this dataset, the City Hotel has been experiencing a large number of hotel booking cancellations, which
has had an impact on the revenue stream of the business. The aim of this Exploratory Data Analysis is in
the identification of trends amongst the people cancelling to better manage the Hotels expectations. We
have decided to look at the City Hotel data purely in order to find the trends in cancellation.
