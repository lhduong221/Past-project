In this module, I learnt about machine learning classification model and how to implement them using Python. 

The models learnt are: Logistic Regression (with Ridge and Lasso), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discrimination Analysis (QDA)
